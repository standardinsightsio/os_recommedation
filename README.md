Item recommendation system based on the customer purchase pattern

# Data Collection:
Track customer purchases: The system gathers information on what customers buy, including items, quantities, timestamps, and potentially demographics.

# Recommendation Techniques:
- Collaborative Filtering: This approach analyzes the behavior of similar customers. It finds customers with purchase histories resembling a specific customer and recommends items those similar customers frequently buy but the target customer hasn't purchased yet. There are two sub-types:
  - User-based Collaborative Filtering: Identifies similar customers and recommends items they have purchased.
  - Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Identifies similar items based on purchase history and recommends them to customers who bought a particular item.
- Content-based Filtering: This technique focuses on the characteristics of the items themselves. It analyzes the attributes of products a customer has purchased (e.g., brand, color, size) and recommends items with similar attributes.
